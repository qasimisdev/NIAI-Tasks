# Task 19 - different ways to loop

# enumerate gives index and value

# enumerate starting from 1
for i, c in enumerate(colors, start=1):

# zip loops two lists together

# reversed

# sorted (doesn't change the original)

# items() on a dictionary

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, "->", v)

# list comprehension

# nested loops: pattern

# iterator by hand
